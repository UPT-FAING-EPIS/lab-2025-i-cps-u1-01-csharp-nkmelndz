üYour project contains only TEST-code for language C# and no MAIN-code for any language, so only TEST-code related results are imported. Many of our rules (e.g. vulnerabilities) are raised only on MAIN-code. Read more about how the SonarScanner for .NET detects test projects: https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-scanner-msbuild/wiki/Analysis-of-product-projects-vs.-test-projects’˜âªÞ2Ï
ÅThe sonar.sources and sonar.tests properties are not supported by the Scanner for .NET and are ignored. They are automatically computed based on your repository. You can fine-tune the analysis and exclude some files by using the sonar.exclusions, sonar.inclusions, sonar.test.exclusions, and sonar.test.inclusions properties.È™âªÞ2Õ
ËMulti-Language analysis is enabled. If this was not intended and you have issues such as hitting your LOC limit or analyzing unwanted files, please set "/d:sonar.scanner.scanAll=false" in the begin step.È™âªÞ2
